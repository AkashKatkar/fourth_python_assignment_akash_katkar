# 📄 Python File Handling – Assignment

This program demonstrates basic file handling operations in Python, including reading, writing, appending and error handling.

---

## 🧪 Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
This task performs the following:
- Attempts to open and read a file named **`sample.txt`**.
- Prints its content **line by line**, while skipping empty lines.
- Handles errors gracefully using `try-except`, including:
  - **FileNotFoundError** if the file does not exist.
  - Any other unexpected exceptions.

---

## ✏️ Task 2: Write, Append, and Read File Data
This task:
- Takes user input and **writes** it to **`output.txt`**.
- Takes more user input and **appends** it to the same file.
- Reads and displays the **final content** of the file.

## 🎯 Concepts Practiced
- File operations: `read`, `write`, `append`
- Error handling using `try-except`
- Line-by-line file processing
- Input handling
- Data cleaning with `strip()` and `filter()`
